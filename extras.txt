1. Commands used to commit my code to Git:
	cd d:vote_for_event (I moved my module files from F/wamp64/www/drupal-8.6.2/modules/vote_for_event because it is more handy to push)
	git init
	git add .
	git commit -m "Vote for Event Drupal 8 module 1.0"
	git remote add origin https://github.com/sjnsmnkl/Vote.git
	git push -u origin master

2. How to protect the form from users submitting several votes for the same event or other forms of voting manipulation?
	Try verifing email address by sending Verification Code to users' email.
